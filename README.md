##AIM

Built an encrypted end to end chat with minimum user information footprint

### Actions in general
- registration
- login
- find people using avatar name
- chat and file sending using storage public gpg encryption
- Messages and files are stored encrypted

### Considerations:
- Only API in the first phase 
- Lets just store everything in the database
- Search also in the database
- request to chat/block [Next version]
- No Group chats as of now (lets think about it later)
